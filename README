Edit vendor/cyanogen/vendorsetup.sh to add a lunch “combo” for the U8110:
add_lunch_combo cyanogen_u8110-eng

Add a makefile for the u8110:
cp vendor/cyanogen/products/cyanogen_u8220.mk vendor/cyanogen/products/cyanogen_u8110.mk

Edit vendor/cyanogen/products/cyanogen_u8110.mk, replacing occurances of “u8220″ with “u8110″ (pay attention to case!).
Use common sense. Basically, tailor the new makefile to be U8110 specific. 
Pay specific attention to the paths to makefiles and such, as they need more intelligence than just a search/replace…

Edit vendor/cyanogen/products/AndroidProducts.mk to add the following line:
$(LOCAL_DIR)/cyanogen_u8110.mk \
This tells the build system where to find the device’s makefile.

Check out a copy of my u8110 device tree:
cd device/huawei


Copy proprietary files
either by running extract-files.sh with a device connected in 
or by running unzip-files.sh with a u8160 stock rom placed in as u8110.zip

Set up the build environment:
. build/envsetup.sh
brunch u8110
